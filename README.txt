		  Midnight

	Alright, so you downloaded Midnight, the
best selfbot for discord. This is a step by step-ish guide.
If you mess something up, just download it again, and
follow this guide.

		Instructions

	    Installing Midnight Self Bot

1.  Hit "Code" on github and then hit "Download ZIP"
2. Once it's finished downloading, unzip the file and
    move it to somewhere you won't forget it.
3. After that, continue the guide.

	                 Setting It up

1. Open the Config file (Config.bat). This will prompt
    you to input some information you need for
    Midnight, your key, your token (for it to work),
    and your prefix. The bot will not work without your
    key and token.
2. After it says to run MidnightSelfBot.bat, run the
    file from the same folder called MidnightSelfBot
    (MidnightSelfBot.bat). This will give you the info
    you need (invalid token/invalid key). If it doesn't,
    and shows you MIDNIGHT, Midnight has been
    set up and is ready for you to use.

      We hope you have a great time using Midnight
